# Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Demo page video player dimensions were wrong
**Problem**: Video player had fixed dimensions that didn't scale properly.

**Solution**: 
- Removed fixed `width="100%"` and `height="500"` attributes
- Added responsive VideoJS setup: `"responsive": true, "fluid": true, "aspectRatio": "16:9"`
- Added CSS: `width: 100%; max-width: 100%;` for proper scaling

### 2. ✅ Folders inside videojs-skins-archive were mostly empty
**Problem**: Skin folders lacked actual content files.

**Solution**:
- Added individual CSS files for major skins:
  - `youtube-style/style.css` - Complete YouTube-style skin
  - `netflix-dark/style.css` - Netflix dark theme
  - `sublime/style.css` - Sublime skin with cyan accents
  - `iplayer/style.css` - BBC iPlayer orange theme
  - `material-design/style.css` - Material Design blue theme
- Added README.md files with usage instructions
- Created proper folder structure with actual downloadable resources

### 3. ✅ Skins grid preview images don't work - no images shown
**Problem**: Preview images used non-working placeholder URLs.

**Solutions**:
- Updated all placeholder URLs from `https://placeholder.com/` to `https://via.placeholder.com/`
- Changed dimensions from `800x450` to `400x240` for better grid display
- Added proper error handling with `onerror` attribute for image fallbacks
- Used URL encoding for skin names in fallback images
- Colors now match each skin's theme (e.g., red for YouTube, cyan for Sublime)

### 4. ✅ Can't set custom hotkeys inside the settings tab
**Problem**: Hotkey inputs were read-only with no functionality to change them.

**Solutions**:
- Removed `readonly` attribute from hotkey inputs
- Added interactive hotkey capture functionality:
  - Click input and press any key to set new hotkey
  - Visual feedback during key capture
  - Automatic saving to localStorage
  - Proper focus/blur handling
- Enhanced CSS styling:
  - Added hover effects
  - Better focus indicators
  - Improved visual feedback
  - Larger input fields for better usability
